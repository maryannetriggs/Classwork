# Client Side Testing Lab

_This can be done individually, but you are encouraged to work in pairs for this lab_ 

Using the starter code provided, write tests for the following problems:

1. A function which takes a number and returns 'Fizz' if the number is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if the number is divisible by 5, 'Fizzbuzz' divisible by both and the number is not divisible by 3 or 5

1. A function which takes an array of numbers and returns the index of the highest value

1. A function which takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the 3 highest values

1. Calculate the Price of an ice-cream. A function which takes either one or two numbers, the first number being the number of scoops. The second being the number of flakes. Scoops cost 1.20. Flakes cost 0.55. The function returns the the price of the ice-cream.

1. Tax Calculator - Write a function that takes two arguments, an amount in pounds (Â£) and a tax percentage (as a decimal (0.2) or a whole number (20) both being 20%). Return a string 'Your tax is Xp'.

Once you have completed tests for a problem, make the tests pass.

## Tips

* If you are working in a pair, swap between writing tests and making them pass.
* If you are not sure what to test, imagine how you would manually test that your function works. What would you log to the console, and what would you expect that log to be.
