# Functions Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Let's practice writing some functions!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Follow the requirements in the list below:

1. Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. Do some Googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.
2. Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel and false, otherwise.
3. Write a function that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
4. Define a function `reverseString` that reverses a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".


#### Starter Code

Open the file `js/app.js` - all the function names are already inside the file.  You just need to implement the functions by adding code inside each one.

Use the Chrome dev tools console to view the output.

#### Deliverable

You'll review the answers with the instructor in class.
